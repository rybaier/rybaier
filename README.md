# Hello! 

I am looking to break into the software industry. With proven experience from my education in being able to absorb new languages in a functional and effective manner to write clean and effective code, I hope to find a position where mentorship and growth are available.
From my resume, you will see that I have a wide variety of experience and skills, and the one thing I have learned the most is that all skills translate in some way to every position one chooses to work in. I recently graduated from my Software Engineering Immersive program at, General Assembly on March 16th, 2022.

- I am versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React-Native, MERN,  PostgreSQL, Python, Django Framework, GO(Golang), Rust, and Git workflow. 
Since graduation, I have continued to work on personal projects and expand my education while working as a Seasonal River Guide over the summer and a Freelance Software Developer. While I do not have multiple years of experience in the technology industry. I bring a tenacity for growth and learning that has been focused on developing software engineering skills over the last 12 months. That focus has developed into a passion for the capabilities of software development and what it can achieve and I look forward to seeing how far I can go.

## Personal Projects 
- [Place Your Bet!](https://rybaier.github.io/Place-Your-Bets/) A simple Web Browser game called Place Your Bets based on the horse racing gambling industry built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS

- [Travel-Watcher](https://travel-watcher.herokuapp.com/) A Full MERN stack application called Travel Watcher that is an app for tracking travel expenses both on the go. It stores each trip so it can be referenced for future travel planning. (These repos are housed within the github organization WaterMERN on my github profile) MERN Stack
- [PrEvac App](https://github.com/rybaier/PrEvac) (In development) A Mobile Evacuation Assistance App to help individuals, families and friends reduce the stress and have a plan when the need to evacuate their home arises. I have continued to work on this since graduation and plan to deploy to app store in Early 2023


### Game Development
- I started learning Rust to get an introduction to systems programming and game engines. Taking the ultimate rust crash course 1 and 2 with Nathan Stocks on Udemy where I built a Space Invaders clone and a simple crab squish game by following his tutorial and am learning on how to add my own flair to them

- I most recently Started taking a course focused on the Unreal Engine 5 with hopes to break into the game develpoment world

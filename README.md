# Hello
##### ~ Activily looking for new position ~
I am actively seeking a company that fosters a culture centered on mentorship and personal growth. Intrigued by challenging problems, I bring a unique perspective on achieving desired results and value strong team-based skills. My unwavering dedication is directed towards the continuous expansion of my knowledge and experience as a software developer. I bring a tenacity for growth and learning that has been focused on developing software engineering skills. That focus has developed into a passion for the capabilities of software development and what it can achieve. I've honed my skills through both work and personal projects while balancing roles as a Seasonal River Guide and a Freelance Software Developer.

# Hello

With proven experience from my education in being able to absorb new languages in a functional and effective manner to write clean and effective code, I hope to find a position where mentorship and growth are available.
I recently graduated from my Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly in 2022.

##### Skills and Languages worked with
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,react,express,postgres,py,django,go,rust,git,github&perline=4)](https://skillicons.dev)

Since graduation, I have continued to work on personal projects and expand my education while working as a Seasonal River Guide over the summer and a Freelance Software Developer. I bring a tenacity for growth and learning that has been focused on developing software engineering skills over the last 12 months. That focus has developed into a passion for the capabilities of software development and what it can achieve.

I have been focused mainly on Object Oriented Programming over the last 6 months

## Favorite Personal Projects 
- [Place Your Bet!](https://rybaier.github.io/Place-Your-Bets/) A simple Web Browser game called Place Your Bets based on the horse racing gambling industry built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS [repo](https://github.com/rybaier/Place-Your-Bets)
- [Lord of the Rings Toilet Time](https://lotr-toilet-time.netlify.app/) A REACT application with API calls. Which is a simple web application that allows one to waste time playing a Movie quotes Quiz and discover information about random characters in Tolkienâ€™s literary universe [repo](https://github.com/rybaier/LOTR-TT-React-API)
- [PrEvac App](https://github.com/rybaier/PrEvac) (In development) A Mobile Evacuation Assistance App to help individuals, families and friends reduce the stress and have a plan when the need to evacuate their home arises. I have continued to work on this since graduation and plan to deploy to app store in Early 2023


### Game Development
- I started learning Rust to get an introduction to systems programming and game engines. Taking the ultimate rust crash course 1 and 2 with Nathan Stocks on Udemy where I built a Space Invaders clone and a simple crab squish game by following his tutorial and am learning on how to add my own flair to them these are under my [Rust-Crash-Course repo](https://github.com/rybaier/Rust-crash-course) 

- I most recently started taking a course focused on the Unreal Engine 5 with hopes to break into the game develpoment world currently working with Blueprint and working towards C++
